The application that we are creating is not like ones we have done before. The whole purpose of this application is to test our ability and knowledge to code. The application is about a weather app. In the weather app you will find days of the week, weather conditions, and your min and max temperatures. The application will allow us to calculate the average temperatures of the week out of the 5 days. Inside the application you will find 3 main activities will 3 classes. The first activity we created was the splash screen. The whole purpose of the splash screen is to make a neat introduction and get into the main use of the app. The second activity is the main activity . it is where most of the coding is done . we use arrays and we are supposed to initialize. We have to declare and use loops in the right format. The calculation part must be correct and up to standard. There should be buttons that work, an example of that would be a button that clears everything, a button then takes me to the next page, and a button that does the calculating. The final activity we have is the detailed activity. This activity will show us all the information that we need.
